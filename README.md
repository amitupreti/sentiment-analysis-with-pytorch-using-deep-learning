# sentiment-analysis-with-pytorch-using-deep-learning
Here we will pratice how to build a deep learning sentiment analyser with pytorch.

The project is still in development phase.

At the end, we will deploy to a server and use api calls to send text and predict emotion of text.

This project is part of Udacity Deep learning Nano degree.
I am trying to document my learning so that it may be of help to someone who wishes to build a full production deep learning solutions.
